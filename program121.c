/*
Q121: Write a C program that creates a text file named info.txt in write mode. The program 
should take the user’s name and age as input, and write them to the file using fprintf(). 
After writing, display a message confirming that the data was successfully saved.

Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
Name: Rahul, Age: 23
Output 1:
File created successfully! Data written to info.txt

*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    FILE *fp;
    char name[50];
    int age;

    // Open file in write mode
    fp = fopen("info.txt", "w");

    if (fp == NULL) 
    {
        printf("Error! Could not create file.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Taking user input
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    gets(name);

    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d",&age);

    // Writing data to file
    fprintf(fp, "Name: %sAge: %d\n", name, age);

    // Close the file
    fclose(fp);

    // Confirmation message
    printf("File created successfully! Data written to info.txt\n");

    return 0;
