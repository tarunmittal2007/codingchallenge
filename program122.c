/*
Q122: Write a C program that opens an existing file (e.g., info.txt) and reads its 
contents using fgets(). The program should print all the lines to the console until 
EOF (end of file) is reached.

Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
File: info.txt (Content: Name: Rahul\nAge: 23)
Output 1:
Name: Rahul
Age: 23

*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    FILE *fp;
    char line[200];

    // Open file in read mode
    fp = fopen("info.txt", "r");

    if (fp == NULL) 
    {
        printf("Error! File not found.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Read and print lines until EOF
    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), fp) != NULL) 
    {
        printf("%s", line);
    }

    // Close file
    fclose(fp);

    return 0;
}
